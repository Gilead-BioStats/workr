# Pharamaverse Case Study

## Background

The `pharmaverse` has rapidly emerged as an open-source standard for
clinical trial reporting. Core packages such as `sdtm.oak` support SDTM
transformations, while `admiral` provides a robust framework for ADaM
derivations. Downstream, a rich ecosystem of visualization tools enables
production-ready outputs — including tabular summaries with `gtsummary`
and safety visualizations via `safetyCharts`. At the same time, the
CDISC Analysis Results Standard (ARS) is gaining momentum, with packages
like `cards` beginning to support ARS-aligned workflows. Complementing
traditional static deliverables, many organizations are increasingly
adopting Shiny and web-based review tools to enable interactive
exploration of clinical data.

In parallel, the gsm framework — particularly the gsm.core package — has
matured into a YAML-driven workflow engine designed to deliver
reproducible, traceable, and audit-ready pipelines for clinical data
science. The framework currently powers a standardized Risk-Based
Quality Monitoring (RBQM) infrastructure, pairing flexible data
workflows with robust reporting systems such as those demonstrated in
[`gsm.kri`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/).

Historically, the `pharmaverse` and `gsm` ecosystems have evolved along
separate trajectories. However, their complementary strengths present a
compelling opportunity for integration: combining pharmaverse’s
domain-specific data standards and reporting capabilities with gsm’s
workflow orchestration and auditability could form the foundation of a
fully traceable, end-to-end clinical reporting pipeline.

With the introduction of {workr} as a standalone workflow engine, we can
now explore how these ecosystems can harmonize to deliver cohesive,
reproducible pipelines that lower barriers to adopting open-source R
infrastructure in regulated clinical trial reporting.

## Objective

We present a pipeline that demonstrates how {workr} can orchestrate
`pharmaverse` packages across the full reporting lifecycle —
transforming raw eCRF data into SDTM, ADaM, TFL outputs, and ARS-aligned
deliverables. Through this case study, we illustrate how harmonizing
these ecosystems enables a cohesive, reproducible workflow that lowers
barriers to adopting open-source R infrastructure in regulated clinical
trial reporting.

## Methods

- {workr} engine: In this framework, workflows are defined declaratively
  using YAML configuration files organized into three sections:

1.  Meta — captures descriptive metadata and documentation associated
    with the workflow
2.  Spec — declares required data sources and their structural
    requirements, defining the inputs needed for downstream derivations
    and transformations
3.  Steps — specifies the execution pipeline. Each step is written as an
    {output, name, params} block:

&nbsp;

    - output:
      name:
      params: 

Where, `output` represents the returned object, `name` identifies the
function being executed, and `params` contains the function arguments.
At runtime,
[`RunWorkflows()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/workr/reference/RunWorkflows.md)
parses these step definitions and orchestrates their execution
sequentially, effectively reproducing the behavior of a piped R command.

- Raw → SDTM ([workr +
  sdtm.oak](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/workr/articles/SDTM_example)):
  Raw eCRF data were transformed into SDTM using {workr}-driven
  workflows aligned with established `sdtm.oak` implementation patterns.
  The workflow mirrors the VS domain example from the official vignette,
  demonstrating how standardized SDTM mappings can be embedded within a
  reproducible YAML pipeline. The reference implementation is available
  [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtm.oak/articles/findings_domain.html).

- SDTM → ADaM ([workr +
  admiral](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/workr/articles/ADAM_example)):
  SDTM domains were reintroduced into the workflow engine and processed
  through admiral derivations to construct ADaM datasets. Functions such
  as `derive_vars_merged()` and `derive_param_map()` generated ADVS
  parameters and analysis values (e.g., MAP), with derivation logic
  expressed via !expr tags. This approach preserves transparency while
  ensuring transformations remain reproducible and audit-ready. The
  admiral vignette that demonstrates these functions can be found
  [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/articles/bds_finding.html?q=advs#derive_param).

- ADaM → TFLs ([workr + gtsummary +
  safetyCharts](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/workr/articles/visualizations)):
  The resulting ADaM datasets fed directly into visualization steps,
  invoking `gtsummary` for tabular summaries and `safetyCharts` for
  graphical outputs. This enables generation of publication-ready TFLs
  within a fully traceable end-to-end pipeline, adaptable to an
  organization’s visualization standards. Beyond static reporting, the
  same workflows can automatically refresh web-based or HTML
  applications as new data are derived, supporting near real-time
  exploratory analysis and safety review.

- ADaM → ARS ([workr +
  cards](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/workr/articles/ARS_example)):
  In parallel, the derived ADaM datasets were extended using cards to
  prototype ARS-aligned datasets and outputs. Although the ARS standard
  is still evolving, this example illustrates how emerging libraries can
  be integrated into the {workr} framework with minimal friction,
  enabling early adoption of new reporting standards within an existing,
  reproducible workflow.

## Results / Conclusion

Each package preserved its modular design, while {workr} provided
centralized workflow control, auditability, and reproducibility across
the pipeline.

This pharmaverse case study demonstrates the feasibility of a fully
open-source, end-to-end clinical reporting workflow. In this model,
{workr} serves as the orchestration backbone, while pharmaverse packages
deliver domain-specific transformations spanning SDTM, ADaM, TFLs, and
ARS. Together, they form a modular, transparent, and automation-ready
reporting architecture. We propose this integration as a blueprint for
future collaboration between workflow frameworks and pharmaverse tools,
advancing the industry toward interoperable, open-source clinical
reporting standards.
